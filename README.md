<p>All code is provided in the single .cpp file, originally for ease of submission. <strike>Unfortunately, I no longer have the input file.</strike> Found it! Built in Visual Studion 2017.</p>
<p>When provided a correctly formatted input file (which was assumed), the app will output a list of ride matches for rider requests. Inputs included rider and driver profiles, as well as driver availability, rider requests and to- and from-locations for both. Matches are ordered by time from desired departure (in the case of free rides), or by price (in the case of paid 'on-call' rides). The structure of the input file did not lend itself to a polymorphic approach, but since the objective of the project was to show proficiency with OOP principals, a switch-like polymorphic approach was taken for input.</p>
